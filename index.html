    <h3>Horses</h3>
  
        I LOVE HORSES! I have loved horses for as long as I can remember and it has never dwindled. I've received
        my first horse at a later age, but she's been the most patient, loving, and wonderful non-verbal partner
        I could ever ask for! Our latest feat is bareback riding - so thrilling (especially on canter)! I also
        volunteer with Camp Casey and Karin's Connection when the help is needed. I continue to look for ways of
        incorporating advocacy for those experiencing disabilities and disparities to share a healing moment with
        horses.

    <h3>Geek</h3>

        I watch anime, play a few video games, and enjoy dabbling into STEM material. My all-time favorites are:
        <li>Anime: Ouran Highschool Host Club</li>
        <li>Video Game: Kingdom Hearts series</li>
        <li>STEM: SQL & databases</li>
    </br>
        I also like a few crafting projects like acrylics, cross-stitching, faux stained glass, and water colors
    </br>

    <h3>Variable</h3>

        I've changed dwelling locations, job titles, educational focus, and (drastic for me) my hair style. I first
        moved from Houston, TX to Cedar Springs, MI as a young teen, then moved (nearly) EVERY YEAR for the next 8 years.
        I'm currently in my (hopefully) forever home and I love the location. I've mostly done Customer Service positions,
        but I've always had a way to work in or coordinate with different departments to keep me busy and help business run
        smoother and efficient. In these journies I fluctuated between Mathematics, Computer Science, Education, 
        Environmental Science, Consulting, Advocacy, and Public Health. Bottom line - I want to help people, and I want to
        be as helpful as I can wherever I am. Lastly, I CUT MY HAIR - AGAIN! 14" is the latest length, and I'm not sure if I'll
        cut it so short ever again, but for now I'm watching the growing process and seeing which length I may like to keep.
